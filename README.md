# LLM-Evaluation-Pipeline
# LLM Response Evaluation Pipeline


The system is designed to analyze conversations between humans and AI models and automatically score responses for:

* Relevance & completeness
* Hallucination / factual grounding (RAG-based)
* Latency
* Token usage & cost

It is built to work **in real time** and **at massive scale** (millions of conversations per day).

---

## Overview

Large Language Models can generate fluent answers—but fluency does not guarantee correctness.

This project provides a **deterministic evaluation layer** that runs *after* an LLM generates a response and *before* it reaches the end user (or is logged for analytics).

The evaluation pipeline consumes:

* **Chat conversation JSON** (multi‑turn)
* **Context / vector store JSON** (retrieved RAG evidence)

and produces:

* A **structured evaluation report** that can be used for guardrails, dashboards, alerts, or offline audits.

---

## Features

#### Evaluate relevance and completeness

Measure how well the AI response addresses the user’s question and whether required information is missing.

```python
relevance_score = relevance_score(user_query, ai_response)
completeness_score = completeness_score(user_query, ai_response)
```

---

#### Detect hallucinations using retrieved context

Every factual claim in the response is checked against the retrieved knowledge base.

Claims that are **not supported by any vector evidence** are automatically flagged.

```python
hallucination = hallucination_score(ai_response, context_text)
```

This avoids subjective “LLM‑as‑judge” approaches and keeps evaluations explainable.

---

#### Track latency and cost

Measure how long evaluation takes and estimate token‑based cost.

```python
metrics = latency_cost_metrics(start_time, tokens_used)
```

### Evaluation Pipeline Components

1. **Relevance Scorer**
   Compares semantic overlap between the user query and the AI response.

2. **Completeness Checker**
   Ensures expected entities (price, location, dates, etc.) are present.

3. **Hallucination Detector**
   Breaks responses into claims and verifies each against retrieved context.

4. **Latency & Cost Profiler**
   Tracks runtime and estimates cost based on token usage.

---

## Why This Architecture?

### Why not use another LLM as a judge?

Using an LLM to judge another LLM introduces:

* High cost per evaluation
* Increased latency
* Non‑deterministic scoring
* Poor explainability

This pipeline instead uses **evidence‑grounded heuristics**:

* Deterministic
* Cheap to run
* Easy to debug
* Easy to tune per domain

LLMs can still be optionally added later **only for edge cases**.

---

### Why RAG‑anchored hallucination detection?

Hallucinations only matter relative to *available knowledge*.

By grounding evaluation strictly to retrieved vectors:

* The system never penalizes correct but unavailable knowledge
* Every failure can point to missing or incorrect retrieval
* Unsupported claims are explicitly listed

---

## Scalability & Cost Control

This pipeline is designed to run at **millions of evaluations per day**.

### How latency is minimized

* No additional LLM calls during evaluation
* Lightweight string and similarity checks
* Stateless execution
* Parallel‑friendly design

Typical evaluation latency: **milliseconds per response**.

---

### How costs are minimized

* Pure Python heuristics (near‑zero marginal cost)
* Configurable token accounting
* No GPU dependency
* Optional batch processing

Cost per evaluation is effectively negligible compared to LLM inference itself.

  "relevance_score": 0.81,
  "completeness_score": 0.6,
  "hallucination_analysis": {
    "hallucination_score": 0.75,

    "estimated_cost_usd": 0.0009
  },

}
```

## Running at Massive Scale

To support millions of daily conversations:

* Deploy as a **stateless microservice** (FastAPI / Flask)
* Run horizontally behind a load balancer
* Batch offline evaluations where real‑time blocking is not required
* Log structured outputs to analytics systems (BigQuery, ClickHouse, etc.)

---

## Future Improvements

* Claim‑to‑vector citation mapping
* Confidence‑weighted hallucination scoring
* Hybrid LLM‑based evaluation for ambiguous cases
* Automatic response blocking or rewriting

---

## Summary

This evaluation pipeline provides:

* Reliable hallucination detection
* Explainable scoring
* Real‑time performance
* Extremely low cost

It acts as a **safety and quality layer** between LLMs and users, making large‑scale AI deployments safer and more trustworthy.
